 __DEVELOPER REMARKS__
  
  (Shalpreet Kaur):
  In this project I was tasked to complete the To Do planner page. This project was a good refresher on the various class activities that we completed in the class. I was able to pull up this page by taking various references from the class activities, google searches and YouTube videos. I started off with creating the basic layout to match with what David and Caleb had created. I struggled a little bit with storing the data in the local storage and then retrieving it but later figured it out. The page provides user the option to enter the task which then gets stored to the Not Completed list. When the task is in the Not completed list, the user has the option to either delete the task or mark it as Complete. When the task is marked as complete it shows up in the Completed section. The main page shows in a nutshell how many pending tasks the user has. This was a great Project and I Iearned a lot. I was a little nervous initially because this is the first time I was working as a part of a team. But the way things worked out, I feel great and very happy about it. The team was very supportive and helpful.

   For this project, I was given the responsibility of making the money budgeting application. I have worked for a CPA firm for a little over 2 years now. And it has given me a perspective of how important keeping track of finances can be! So I set out on creating an aspect of our website that made keeping track of your money easier. First I started by deciding what i wanted specifically the page to do. I had originally wanted the user to be able to link their bank account and see their transactions in real time. But that proved to be more than what i expected for me to create at my current level of knowledge and practice. So i decided to take the basic idea and make it just that. Basic and easy to use! SO i  have a simple place to enter the amount you wish to budget, then the categories appear for the user to pick what percentage they wish each category to be. Then the money is displayed in its dispered form based off the percentages that were picked. 
   Because we needed to use a new CSS framework in this project, I decided to build it using Tailwind. Learning Tailwind was deffinetly a fun and challenging experience. But I now have a decent grasp of how it works! This was an awesome project and i had a lot of frun building it with the team!
  
  (David Lindner):
  In this application  was tasked with creating the Weather and Food Diary components of Life Organizer. When my teammates and I were brainstorming ideas on what to create     for our application we kept coming up withideas that are day to day occurences, like a to-do list. On the daily I personally use a calorie tracker and I thought that would   be a perfect addition and would be would fit the theme of our project well. I leanred a lot about using different third party APIs and how to manipulate them to get the       information that I desired. I used Nutritionix API in my Food Diary to get the calorie values of searched food by the user. The hardest part of this portion was figuring     out how to remove calories from the total once the user deletes it from the diary. I ended up having to use a '.off().on()' click event listener and that fixed all the       problems that I was coming across. Secondly, I tasked myself with creating the weather feature. It was not too difficult to figure out, as I had done it before; but I did     not want to do it the same way. I used the built in 'navigator' method to allow me to get the timezone of the user and use that to insert into the API and then display       stats from there. Altogether, it was a great time and a great experience with the team.
